Wow, time surely flies by, the due date approaches (approx. 1 month from now). We have been seeing a lot of doctors and have even met the surgeon that will likely perform the surgery.

A slight change in diagnosis however, from the first full blown HLHS to a slightly favorable defect called “Unbalanced Atrioventricular Canal Defect.” This is slightly different than full blown HLHS, is that the left side of the heart is much smaller than normal, however it is not completely “missing” as a full blown HLHS patient would have. This means that some of the parts on the left side “could” be used. He did say it all depends on how she does when she is born, and they won’t know for sure until they see her directly.


The surgeon also explained that this could mean that they would be doing a “modified” Norwood procedure. Though this seems like good news, however it still requires a bypass–open heart surgery 3 or 4 days after birth. Plus the additional 2 more open heart surgeries (Glenn procedure, Fontan procedure) later in life…

This is difficult to comprehend, and questions swirl “why us?”
This passage has helped me:

II Cor 13
9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
