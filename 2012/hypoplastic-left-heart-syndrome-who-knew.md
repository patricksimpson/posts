Recently we have found out during a routine ultra sound, our (expecting) child has been diagnosed with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS). While this is a rare congenital heart condition, it has a major (open heart) surgical intervention, called the Norwood procedure.


This news was a bombshell (I do mean we were shocked to the core), we have since been researching and reading about the surgery. We now have a much better understanding of the condition, and how it is treated. This gives us both confidence, as does our faith, that we will be given a chance.

The Norwood procedure is a open heart surgery that is required within the first week of life. This surgery enables the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body, otherwise it would be impossible for the heart to deliver the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. This would be fatal without this intervention.

We have since seen a cardiologist, and was given a bit of hopeful information about our specific case. Our baby, while does have the condition, is considered lower risk than other babies with the same defect. While the surgery is not always successful, the cardiologist is hopeful as are we.

Now we waitâ€¦
