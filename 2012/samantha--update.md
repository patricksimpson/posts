I just wanted to update everyone to let them know that surgery is on schedule for Friday. The doctors are concerned that her lungs are just not strong enough though, which puts her at a high risk. It’s a tough situation, but she is in great need of this surgery. They said the recovery could be months.

We appreciate all the thoughts, prayers, cards, gift cards, and flowers. Really we are truly blessed to have some many friends out here. Thank you all!
