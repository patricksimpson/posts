## Vim

Much like Aaron Bieber, I started out coding using Vim.

I love Vim. It is still, probably one of the greatest editors of all time. And being an EVIL mode user, I love the default keybindings Vim has to offer.

Vim is, highly configurable with many packages/plugins available.
There's a steep learning curve, but worth the productivity increase overtime.
The biggest advantage to Vim Bindings is you never have to take your hands off the keyboard or even far from the “home row”.

Vim was designed to be used on systems without Graphical User Interfaces, with limited mouse support. This is a huge advantage on servers.

## Customize

What all these years of Vim has thaught me is, learn to customize.
