OK this is a RANT. You've been warned...

JavaScript is getting crazy... It's the world wide trash heap where anything goes. Nothing is right, nothing is wrong. 
I mean, I love JavaScript, but the language isn't that great. 

We've created tools like "TypeScript" to make it better, but JavaScript code is still only as good as it's written and maintained. 

Good code, is good code. It's not easy to define that. Like Phaedrus in Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintaince... "quality". 
Go ahead, try to define "quality." I can tell you that it's infinatly granular. And yet everyone has a different opinion on what
"good code" is. But, you'll know it when you see it. 

So before you start your next project, ask yourself....

Why React?
Why Gatsby? 
Why CSS in JS?
Why all these depedendies did we need all this stuff? Or can you just get by with some native HTML/CSS/JS? 

I am sure you'll be able to create something. Or is it that we've invented our selves something some complex, so crazily time consuming, you'll
need to read a few books or some good tutorials on first. What's up with that anyway?

But, we're all humans and we'll solve more problems with more problems. Of course that is, until the next shiny thing comes out.
Then we'll have to keep solving problems with more different problems. 
By the way, make sure you upgrade to the latest OS/Macbrick pro 2021 version for 32 gigs of ram, 
you're going to need it if you want to solve problems.
