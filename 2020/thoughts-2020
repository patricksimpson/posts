This year has been interesting to say the least... 
Nice try 2020


JavaScript is getting crazy. The bloat, the misuse of. JS everywhere. It's the world wide trash heap. 
Don't get me wrong, I love JavaScript, but the language isn't that great. I mean, we've created tools like TypeScript to make it better, but it's still only as good as it's maintained. 
Good code, is good code. It's not easy to define "quality". Go ahead, try to define "quality" it's infinate granularity, everyone has a different opinion on what
"good code" is, but you know it when you see it, right? 

I've been reading the book "start with Why?"...

Why React?
Why Gatsby? 
Why CSS in JS?
Why all these depedendies did we need all this stuff? 


we need a big ginat pause button on things, but everyone has to keep pushing. We have to keep solving problems with more problems 
and we're not getting anywhere fast.
