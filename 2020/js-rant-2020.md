I love JavaScript. It's easy, to write, easy to understand. We've created tools like "TypeScript", Babel, Webpack, React (to name a few), to make it better. What I've noticed lately, is just [unhealthy](https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/gatsby). It's tough to describe this problem, other than a simple "feeling" of increasing bloat, and decreasing understandig of the fundementals. What I've realized now is, this is how I define quality.

### Quality?

[Quality](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quality), it's not easy to define that as websters would. Like Phaedrus in [Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintaince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)... "quality". 
Go ahead, try to define "quality." I can tell you that it's infinatly granular. And yet everyone has a different opinion on what
"good code" is. But, you'll know it when you see it. 

Before you start your next project, ask yourself....
