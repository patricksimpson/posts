This is a *RANT*. You've been warned. 

JavaScript is getting crazy... It's starting to [feel like a world wide trash heap.](https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/gatsby) I mean, I love JavaScript. It's easy, to write, easy to understand. It least I think it is, or was, perhaps, could be? Now, we've created tools like "TypeScript", Babel, Webpack, and React, of course, to make it better (more good?)...
but JavaScript code is still only as good as it's written and maintained of course. The useage of the aforemenetioned tools doesn't make it _good_ believe me. 

### Quality?

What is good? It's not easy to define that. Like Phaedrus in [Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintaince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)... "quality". 
Go ahead, try to define "quality." I can tell you that it's infinatly granular. And yet everyone has a different opinion on what
"good code" is. But, you'll know it when you see it. 

Before you start your next project, ask yourself....

Why React?
Why Gatsby? 
Why CSS in JS?
Why all these depedendies... do you really _need_ all this stuff? 

Or can you just get by with some vanallina HTML/CSS/JS? 
[Just remember that entropy is real, and this post sums that up pretty nicely.](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech)

I am sure you'll be able to create something. Or is it that we've invented ourselves something so complex, so crazily time consuming, you'll
need to read a few books or some good tutorials on first. Did we invent the thing to solve the problem to write the book about how it can solve your problems?

But, we're all humans and we'll solve more problems with new problems. That is of course, until the next new _dingus_ comes out.
Then we'll have to solve the same problems, in a new different ways. More exicting different new problems, we can solve those problems with more new problems. 

By the way, make sure you upgrade to the latest OS/Macbrick Pro 2021 version for 32 gigs of ram... 
You're going to need it if you want to solve problems. 

Alright, now back to my Rust tutorial.
