I love JavaScript. It's easy, to write, easy to understand. What I've noticed lately, is [unhealthy](https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/gatsby). It's tough to describe this problem, other than a simple "feeling" of increasing bloat, and decreasing understanding of the fundamentals. This is how I define quality (or the lack therof). 

#### [Why React?](https://css-tricks.com/project-need-react/)

Know when to reach for it. You don't need it for every project. 
 
#### [Why Hooks?](https://medium.com/swlh/the-ugly-side-of-hooks-584f0f8136b6) 

I know why we created hooks. But it's answering the wrong question. React is still bad at state management. It's something EmberJS got better.

#### [Why Gatsby?](https://cra.mr/an-honest-review-of-gatsby/)

Like React, know what you're getting into. It's a big project, full of dependencies, opinions. It can get out of hand. Remember that [entropy is real](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech).

#### [Why CSS in JS?](https://gomakethings.com/whats-wrong-with-css-in-js/)

The biggest issue I have with it, thinking CSS is "just" another programming language. It's not. It's "The global namespace is a feature" of CSS. It's what makes it so incredibly powerful.

#### Vanilla

Can you get by with some vanilla HTML/CSS/JS?  
 - JS has been around for a long time and it's getting better. It's been the language of the web for 25 years.
 - HTML, it's everything you see on the web. Don’t worry about the “shadow DOM”. HTML It's been around for a long time and has changed little and it’s easy to understand.
 - CSS just works. (I still remember being blown away by http://www.csszengarden.com/.)


### Quality?

[Quality](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quality), it's not easy to define that as websters would have you believe. Like Phaedrus in [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)... "quality". 
Try to define "quality." It's infinitely granular. And yet everyone has a different opinion on what "good" "quality" code is. 

But, you'll know it when you see it.
