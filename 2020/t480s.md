After using a mac for my primary development machine for about 10 years,  I recently obtained the lenovo thinkpad t480s instead of a new mackbook.

Here's the basic specs...

Processor: i5-8250U

Display Type: 14.0" FHD (1920 x 1080)

Memory: 16g DDR4 (8 gig DDR4 + 8 gig DDR4)

Harddrive: 256g SSD (PCIe)

The price difference between the 500g and the 256g was about 100 dollars. I debated getting the 500g/1tb versions but opted to do that upgrade afterwards (just as I did the extra ram). For this setup, I will buy a 1tb M.2 NVMe Drive. This will end up costing about the same as the 500g version but with 750 more gigs. 

## First Impressions

The first noticble difference was the keyboard of course. Being very displeased with the latest keyboard that comes standard on the 2018-2019 macbooks this was a solid improvement. The keys are (subjectively) better for me. I prefer a stiffer key and the slightly raised keys on this lenovo fits the bill. 

Next, I spent a good while installing an alternate operating system. The lenovo t480s I bought shipped with windows 10. I had no intention on using that OS at all on this laptop, so I had downloaded a recommended OS (debian based) PopOS (version 19). 

First time around I had some issues with forgetting to turn off "secureboot" in the bios, which caused the bootloader to fail several times. I reinstalled the OS thinking it would be resolved, which caused me to lose a few hours of sleep waiting on the final OS install. Whoops... lesson learned.

**Turn OFF safeboot before (or after) installing a linux OS**

## Development Setup

I've written about this in the past and PopOS is really similar to my previous ubuntu development setup. 

Emacs is my primary IDE/Editor so no reason to switch to anything there.

Gnome tweaks is essential to a proper setup. To make my experience more like a mac some "advanced" keybinds were put in place. Here are the settings that make my experience a bit better

Ctrl position: Swap Left Alt with Left Ctrl
Caps Lock Behavior: Make Caps Lock an additional Esc
Alt/Win Behavior: Ctrl is mapped to Alt; Alt is mapped to Win

gTile is good, but can get messy when you start customizing it. 

Terminal is good enough. 

Signal and Discord for chatting (works just fine in linux)!

So far that's it. My next post will be on my new emacs configuration.
