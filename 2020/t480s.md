After using a mac for my primary development machine for about 10 years,  I recently obtained the lenovo thinkpad t480s instead of a new mackbook.

Here's the basic specs

Processor: i5-8250U

Display Type: 14.0" FHD (1920 x 1080)

Memory: 16g DDR4 (8 gig DDR4 + 8 gig DDR4)

Harddrive: 256 SSD (PCIe)

### First Impressions

The first noticble difference was the keyboard of course. Being very displeased with the latest keyboard that comes standard on the 2018-2019 macbooks this was a solid improvement. The keys are (subjectively) better for me. I prefer a stiffer key and the slightly raised keys on this lenovo fits the bill. 

Next, I spent a good while installing an alternate operating system. The lenovo t480s I bought shipped with windows 10. I had no intention on using that OS at all on this laptop, so I had downloaded a recommended OS (debian based) PopOS (version 19). First time around I had some issues with forgetting to turn off "secureboot" in the bios settings, which caused the bootloader to fail several times, I reinstalled the OS thinking it would be resolved which only caused me to lose a few hours of sleep waiting on the final OS install. Whoops, lesson learned. Turn OFF safeboot before (or after) installing a linux OS!

## Linux Development Setup

I've written about this in the past, and PopOS is really similar to my previous ubuntu dev setup. 

Emacs is my primary IDE/Editor so no reason to switch to anything there.

Gnome tweaks is essential to a proper setup. To make my experience more like a mac some "advanced" keybinds were put in place. Here are the settings that make my experience a bit better

Ctrl position: Swap Left Alt with Left Ctrl
Caps Lock Behavior: Make Caps Lock an additional Esc
Alt/Win Behavior: Ctrl is mapped to Alt; Alt is mapped to Win


gTile is good, but can get messy when you start customizing it. 

terminal is good enough

signal/discord for chatting (works just fine in linux).
