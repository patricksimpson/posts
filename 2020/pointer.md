I've created a simple planning/pointing tool for remote agile teams, check it out:

[https://izerop.com](https://izerop.com).

## Using Pointer

Using the tool is simple, start a “room” by clicking “start session” from the navigation. 
From there, you can copy the link in the URL bar or use the copy link button in the top right under the navigation.
Once in a room, you can cast a vote, show, and clear votes. 

The idea is that you’d use this in addition with other synchronous communication to point your agile stories.

### Open Source

It's open source on github, check it out:

You can fork/copy setup your own server! 

## Tech

Using [Socket.io]: https://socket.io/ and [React]: https://reactjs.org/
