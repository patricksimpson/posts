Alright, typciall these "Hello World" posts are short and sweet. Every blog needs one, so here it is.

## Handmade

This blog is handmade using some of the following:

  - Emacs: Creating and editing posts.
  - AWS/S3: Hosting/Deploying
  - EJS: Templates in JS, yes please.
  - Node (npm): Powerful CLI for building and deploying.
  - JavaScript: The main language for most of my work.

I'll write a little more on how it all works, mainly for my self.

I am starting fresh with this blog, archived old posts. Onward!
