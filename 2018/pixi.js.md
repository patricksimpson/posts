Recently I have been working extensively with Pixi.js http://www.pixijs.com/.

Pixi.js is basically an API sitting on top of WebGL for 2D graphics rendering.

With that, I am amazed at some of the pure power you obtain when weilding this library.

## So Far

So far, I have learned, when living in the land of WebGL, you're on your own.
