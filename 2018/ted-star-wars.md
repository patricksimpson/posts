## Who is Ted Nelson?

Just did some light reading about [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson), the inventor of the hyperlink.
My thoughts: A tad crazy, but has some very interesting ideas.

## The "New" Star Wars Movies

I admit I was a pretty big star wars fan as a child. I would watch and re-watch them.
Yet, all ( yeah, even rouge one) the new star wars movies are boring and don't get rewatched. Why? I will leave this unanswered

I have not seen the Solo (solo) movie. I am not holding my breath.
