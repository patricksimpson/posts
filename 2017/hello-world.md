## Hello World

Hey there. So, I challenged myself to get my blog back up and running by the end of the thanksgiving holiday break (2017). This is my attempt to make it happen using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

I'll write about my experience with Gatsby later, but so far so good. Cheers to Kyle Matthews (and others), for shipping a great product.

## Rambling

I am going to be rambling a lot. I just do. This is what prevents me from posting in the past. Hopefully someone somewhere will get some benefit, I am.
