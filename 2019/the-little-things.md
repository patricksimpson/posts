We own a small flock of chickens. We don't do it for savings on food, by no means does it save us any money on eggs. Free eggs? I don't think so.

Every spring we usually add a few more to the flock. This weekend we picked up a few baby chicks.

This morning, I noticed a chick barely moving...I was sure this chick going to die.
I mentioned to my wife on the way out the door as I certainly didn't have time to care for the little thing... and I expected to bury it later that day.

### Nursing a baby chick back to health:

To my surprise, she revived the chick. Feeding it sugar water and cleaning it's butt, the chick seems perfectly fine now.

The chick had something called “[pasty butt](https://www.raising-happy-chickens.com/pasty-butt.html)” which is pretty common and it is treatable if caught in time.

*The little things matter, that's why we have chickens.*
