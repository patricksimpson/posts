### What has happened to us?

Those who claim not to have time I encourage to dig deep, ask yourself what are you really doing with your time?

Are neverending streaming TV shows really worth your time? Is that sports team winning or losing really going to matter in a few months or years?

Time is undervalued and underutilized...

I remember being bored as a youth. I hated it. I never wanted to experience boredom. Now I argue with my children about how being bored is a good thing!

I long for time to work on hobbies. Time to sit and think about life, past, present, and future? To sit back and enjoy a few spare moments in a book or sitting pondering deeper things.

## Why don't we have time anymore?

I believe Netflix, YouTube, Hulu (plug other streaming services here), facebook, twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc.. has devalued time. They need you to spend your time in their content.

Here’s a thought… Go buy the DVD and watch it. Is your time is worth it? If not, why is endless streaming content worth it?

Unplug yourself from the internet for a week and see a sudden additional amount suddenly appear in your day, like magic.

Everyone is given 24 hours daily, equally. What you choose to do with it is up to you.


### Suggestions to better spend your time wisely

Other things to do with your time:

 - Write.
 - Read books.
 - Meditate, or go to bed early!
 - Exercise.
 - Have a conversation with a friend.
 - Take walks with family/friends (or pet, you get the idea).
 - Learn a new hobby, craft, or build something amazing!
