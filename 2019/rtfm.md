Read the ****ing manual is advice that is given out in one of the most notorious ways.

[RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM), was a term I heard (directed at me, many times) back in the early 2000’s when I was first learning about the linux/unix operating system.
It cuts deep. It can discourage those young eager learners that are just starting out.

Though I would advise against using the phrase, because of it’s crassness; I think it's still _wise_ advice.
Remember, people put a lot of work in the manuals. They want people to read them. Don’t ignore the manuals.
Ensure you read the really nice, sometimes poorly worded, and confusing manuals... if you can.

And make sure you’re eating your own advice, and live by example.
This is totally true for me, I admit, I have not run `man` on every command I’ve ever used.
I know first hand that sometimes you can read a manual and not grok it.
It’s helpful to ask questions to get the clarification you need.
Don’t be afraid to reach out either, I’d be more than willing to help if I can.

Also, check out this website for help on command line: https://explainshell.com/ it's amazing for
detailing out (sometimes complex) linux/unix commands.

Onward!
