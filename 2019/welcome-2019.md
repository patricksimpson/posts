Well this is a first, a first for 2019 anyway! Just wanted to say hello to all my adoring fans out there (ha).

The blogging system seems to be working pretty well from my perspective.
I did manage to finish the [rss feed](/rss.xml). Next step is to hook it up to
micro blog along with micro posts with some "draft" post mode added to my build script.

#### Blog todo:

 - ~~RSS~~
 - ~~Add SSL~~
 - Draft posts
 - Hook up micro posts
 - CI Publishing
 - Photo publishing
 - Extra nice emacs functions for post creation (more on this later)
 - Write a finished post (of course)

Here is to a great 2019!
